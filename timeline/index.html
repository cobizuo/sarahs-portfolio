                    Hello, my name is Sarah Owusu. I am currently a sophomore at Bowie State University (BSU). I plan to graduate with a major in Bioinformatics and minor in Computer Science. While attending a STEM meeting at my previous university (Virginia Commonwealth University), I was able to briefly explore the STEM fields to determine which field would be a good fit for me. In that meeting, I was able to gain technical and hands-on skills applicable to any industry within the STEM fields. This made me gain an interest in multiple fields within STEM. As a result, I became interested in bioinformatics. Bioinformatics is a multidisciplinary field linking biology, computer science, chemistry and mathematics. My main goal is to obtain a career in bioinformatics or any of the similar fields.
